# Defence Kit


* [Snort](https://www.snort.org/) - Snort is a free and open source network intrusion prevention system (NIPS) and network intrusion detection system (NIDS)created by Martin Roesch in 1998. Snort is now developed by Sourcefire, of which Roesch is the founder and CTO. In 2009, Snort entered InfoWorld's Open Source Hall of Fame as one of the "greatest [pieces of] open source software of all time".

* [Bro](https://www.bro.org/) - Bro is a powerful network analysis framework that is much different from the typical IDS you may know.

* [OSSEC](https://ossec.github.io/) - Comprehensive Open Source HIDS. Not for the faint of heart. Takes a bit to get your head around how it works. Performs log analysis, file integrity checking, policy monitoring, rootkit detection, real*time alerting and active response. It runs on most operating systems, including Linux, MacOS, Solaris, HP*UX, AIX and Windows. Plenty of reasonable documentation. Sweet spot is medium to large deployments.

* [Suricata](http://suricata-ids.org/) - Suricata is a high performance Network IDS, IPS and Network Security Monitoring engine. Open Source and owned by a community run non-profit foundation, the Open Information Security Foundation (OISF). Suricata is developed by the OISF and its supporting vendors.

* [Security Onion](http://blog.securityonion.net/) - Security Onion is a Linux distro for intrusion detection, network security monitoring, and log management. It's based on Ubuntu and contains Snort, Suricata, Bro, OSSEC, Sguil, Squert, Snorby, ELSA, Xplico, NetworkMiner, and many other security tools. The easy*to*use Setup wizard allows you to build an army of distributed sensors for your enterprise in minutes!

* [sshwatch](https://github.com/marshyski/sshwatch) - IPS for SSH similar to DenyHosts written in Python.  It also can gather information about attacker during the attack in a log.

* [Stealth](https://fbb*git.github.io/stealth/) - File integrity checker that leaves virtually no sediment. Controller runs from another machine, which makes it hard for an attacker to know that the file system is being checked at defined pseudo random intervals over SSH. Highly recommended for small to medium deployments.

* [AIEngine](https://bitbucket.org/camp0/aiengine) - AIEngine is a next generation interactive/programmable Python/Ruby/Java/Lua packet inspection engine with capabilities of learning without any human intervention, NIDS(Network Intrusion Detection System) functionality, DNS domain classification, network collector, network forensics and many others.

* [Denyhosts](http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/) - Thwart SSH dictionary based attacks and brute force attacks.

* [Fail2Ban](http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) - Scans log files and takes action on IPs that show malicious behavior.

* [SSHGuard](http://www.sshguard.net/) - A software to protect services in addition to SSH, written in C

* [Lynis](https://cisofy.com/lynis/) - an open source security auditing tool for Linux/Unix.

* [OpenSense](https://opnsense.org/) -
Free & Open source - Everything essential to protect your network and more

* [PF Sense](https://www.pfsense.org/) -
pfSense® software is a free, open source customized distribution of FreeBSD specifically tailored for use as a firewall and router that is entirely managed via web interface. In addition to being a powerful, flexible firewalling and routing platform

* [Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/) -
Wazuh is a free, open source and enterprise-ready security monitoring solution for threat detection, integrity monitoring, incident response and compliance.

* [ModSecurity](https://modsecurity.org/) -
Open Source Web Application Firewall

* [Zeek](https://zeek.org/) - 
An Open Source Network Security Monitoring Tool
Zeek (formerly Bro) is the world’s leading platform for network security monitoring.
Flexible, open source, and powered by defenders.


* [ELK Stack](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack) - 
That's Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and Logstash (also known as the ELK Stack). Reliably and securely take data from any source, in any format, then search, analyze, and visualize it in real time. 

* [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) - 
Monitoring system & time series database
An open-source monitoring system with a dimensional data model, flexible query language, efficient time series database and modern alerting approach.

* [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) -
Grafana has become the world’s most popular technology used to compose observability dashboards with everything from Prometheus & Graphite metrics, to logs and application data to power plants and beehives.

* [ElastAlert](https://elastalert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/elastalert.html) -
ElastAlert is a simple framework for alerting on anomalies, spikes, or other patterns of interest from data in Elasticsearch.

* [NAXSI FailToBan](https://github.com/nbs-system/naxsi/wiki/integration-fail2ban) - 
Fail2ban is a nice piece of software allowing you to act on the IP address of someone abusing you, usually banning him using netfilter. Basically you want to ban all skids bruteforcing you SSH service or your webmail login form.
We figured out that dropping skids^Whackers is cool, banning them is even better. So this howto will show you how to ban those who are appearing to much in your naxsi logs.

* [ZAT](https://github.com/SuperCowPowers/zat) - 
Zeek Analysis Tools (ZAT) - The ZAT Python package supports the processing and analysis of Zeek data with Pandas, scikit-learn, Kafka, and Spark

* [Coreruleset](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset) - 
The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is a set of generic attack detection rules for use with ModSecurity or compatible web application firewalls. The CRS aims to protect web applications from a wide range of attacks, including the OWASP Top Ten, with a minimum of false alerts.

* [Ethical Hacking & System Defense](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrentPLOUQnJxPIJy6XlLMgd3mLl3KRn2) - 
Class lectures and demos from my college Ethical Hacking class.
