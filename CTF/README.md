# CTF

* [Security Scenario Generator](https://github.com/cliffe/SecGen) - 
SecGen creates vulnerable virtual machines, lab environments, and hacking challenges, so students can learn security penetration testing techniques.
Boxes like Metasploitable2 are always the same, this project uses Vagrant, Puppet, and Ruby to create randomly vulnerable virtual machines that can be used for learning or for hosting CTF events.
